##### Notes

1. having `div` inside `Switch` triggers "React does not recognize the `computedMatch` prop on a DOM element" warning.

2. I...don't seem to know how to push conditional rendering in the "return" function, I always need to put the condition into a var then render the var -\_-!!

3. How not to change the width of div when the content is bolder in hover ? (ex, encyclopedia of trades project suggestion list)
